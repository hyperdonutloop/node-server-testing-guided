Low hanging fruit.

- the happy path. In a perfect world, how should the system work.
- the other cases. Invalid data, network problems.

Writing tests is also a system's design exercise.

EVERYTHING IS A FUNCTION OR A VALUE.

function (optional args) { return a value }

component (optional props) { return UI }

endpoint (optional data(body/url param/query string/header)) { return response }

## User Story

## Scenario

```
GIVEN a valid username
 and and invalid password
 and
WHEN the user clicks login
THEN the user should not be logged in
  and the system responds with status code 401
  and
```
